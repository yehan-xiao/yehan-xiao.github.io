# Semi-Automatic Utility Classification System (SUCS)

## Project Overview

Semi-Automatic Utility Classification System (SUCS) is a system that is designed to automate the discovery, mapping and documentation of key city infrastructure items (referred to as "Street Furniture" and "Utilities" throughout this document) through the analysis of commercially available, street-level imagery.
SUCS utilises deep-learning based approaches to identify these key infrastructure items, allowing for the automated discovery and mapping of these items.
In doing so, the aim of SUCS is to allow city planners and infrastructure designers to quickly and accurately map a city's current infrastructure.

We consider *key infrastructure item* to be any facility, system or service for serving a country, city or area in the facilitation of economic function,
Examples of a utility item may include:

* Street-lighting and lamp-posts
* Water Supply (Fire Hydrants)
* Street level drainage and manhole covers

Current approaches in documenting and mapping these items are performed manually, if at all.
Generally, city level infrastructure is sporadically detailed using non-standard and inconsistent forms of documentation.
The benefits of SUCS are:

* Automated identification and documentation of infrastructure items
* Broad coverage, limited only by the availability of street level imagery 
* Low-cost
* Standardised output format

The potential application of this approach is not limited to a particular region or country, in-so-long as there is access to the necessary street-level imagery.
