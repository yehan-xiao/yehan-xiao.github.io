description: SUCS is a system that is designed to automate the discovery, mapping and documentation of key city infrastructure items through the analysis of commercially available, street-level imagery. SUCS utilises deep-learning based approaches to identify these key infrastructure items, allowing for the automated discovery and mapping of these items. In doing so, the aim of SUCS is to allow city planners and infrastructure designers to quickly and accurately map a city's current infrastructure. <a href="https://github.com/yehan-xiao/SUCS">Demo Video</a>|<a href="https://github.com/yehan-xiao/SUCS">Code Repository</a>|<a href="https://github.com/yehan-xiao/SUCS-wiki/blob/master/home.md">Project Index</a>
